Gravity Forms - Checkbox Groups
===============================

## About

Gravity Forms: Checkbox Group is an addon for the Gravity Forms WordPress plugin.

Usually, if you have a long list of options in your Checkboxes field, groups of related options are easier to handle for a user. Unfortunately, Gravity Forms does not support groups of options. Not until you install this plugin.

This plugin allows you to group the options in checkboxes fields by implementing &lt;groups&gt; within the native field interface.
